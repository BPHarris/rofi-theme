# rofi-theme

My personal [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) theme and config.

The theme is based on the `glue_pro_blue.rasi` by [Rasmus Steinke](https://github.com/carnager) that comes with Rofi. The main changes are border removal, padding, slight colour and opacity alterations.

The config file contains further styling alterations that are not strictly part of the theme such as location, maximum line count, dynamic line count, fullscreen (default: `false`), icons (default: `false`), and font. Additionally, the config file changes the search matching and `modi`s.
